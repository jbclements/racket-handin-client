racket-handin-client
====================

The plugin to allow handin in csc430. Note: this repo does not need to be
private, because no secrets are stored in it.

## Updated:

There's a tag for each class.

use git tag -m "message" to tag the commit, then push.

## Old:

There's a different branch for each class. Honestly, tags might be a better
mechanism here.
